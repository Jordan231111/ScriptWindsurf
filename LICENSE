Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and the public may use. The following considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. Public License Considerations: The non-exclusive public licenses are designed to allow use of licensed material on certain conditions. The considerations below highlight important elements of these licenses and outline terms and conditions applicable to public use.
   - Considerations for licensors: Creative Commons public licenses are meant for use by those with authority to license. They are also irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand terms and conditions before applying a license.
   - Considerations for the public: Licensors offer the public permission to use licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary, the material may not be covered by these licenses. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights. Use of the material may still be restricted for other reasons. Licensors mark material for which they do not grant permissions as not covered by the license. The licenses do not constitute endorsement. Licensees and creators may add notices of attribution, disclaimer, or sponsorship.
